      <description>Suntimes requires location data to configure dialogs, alarms, and widgets.
It is recommended to configure the app to some user-defined location (such as a local park, intersection, or city center). Suntimes can also periodically query and update using the current location.
User-Defined Location Current (last known) User-Defined Location Suntimes is configured to a user-defined location by default. The use of location permissions is optional.
Configure the location using:
Previous place: choose a previously used place from the drop-down list.</description>
